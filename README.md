# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

A set of activities for different language tracks designed to provide learners with an overview of the concepts of modelling & Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Software Engineering.

## Pre-Requisites

- For the C# language track, we recommend you utilise the community version of Visual Studio 2019 or Visual Studio for Mac available to download for free [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

- For the Java language track, we recommend you utilise the community edition of [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)

## How to Use

- Create a new Github repository called `introduction-to-oop-project` in your personal Github account
- Pick a language track
- Work through the activities in order for that language track and commit your work to your `introduction-to-oop-project` Github repository
- Each activity contains *Key Study Notes* highlighting key concepts for your learning
- The `solutions` folder contains the solutions to the UML diagramming exercises. We recommend you try the exercises first before looking at the final solution for the best learning experience.

## What's Next?

Your learning journey doesn't stop here! Feel free to head back to review the concepts again. We encourage you to do some of your own research and experimentation in your own time to explore these concepts further.
